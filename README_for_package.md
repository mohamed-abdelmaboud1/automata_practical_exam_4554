### The package is designed to solve two main tasks:

- **DFA for Substring '101'**: A Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) designed to check if a binary string contains the substring "101".
---

- **Turing Machine for Divisibility by 3**: A Turing Machine that determines if a binary number is divisible by 3.
